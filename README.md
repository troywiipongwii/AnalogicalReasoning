# AnalogicalReasoning

Agent.py is the most recent Agent built to solve Ravens progressive matrices with visuospatial reasoning. 
AgentText.py was the agent used to solve both B and C with text based reasoning.   Iterations were specific breaks in updating the code
as opposed to small edits.  

The folder was used to test running the agent on a raspberry pi cluster to help learn about parallel processing and is not relevant to the
course other than understanding effeciency and runtime differences.   

This Repo, will be deleted upon final grade to ensure the integrity of the course work for KBAI.
